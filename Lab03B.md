# Lab 3B: Training and Registering Models

Machine Learning is primarily about training models that you can use to provide predictive services to applications; so now it;s time to see how you can use Azure Machine Learning experiments to run training scripts, and how to register the resulting trained models.

## Before You Start

Before you start this lab, ensure that you have completed [Lab 1A](https://github.com/ceteongvanness/Designing-and-Implementing-a-Data-Science-Solution-on-Azure/blob/master/Lab01A.md) and [Lab 1B](https://github.com/ceteongvanness/Designing-and-Implementing-a-Data-Science-Solution-on-Azure/blob/master/Lab01B.md), which include tasks to create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and other resources used in this lab.

## Task 1: Use the Azure Machine Learning SDK to Train and Register Models

In this task, you'll use code in a notebook to run training scripts as Azure Machine Learning experiments.
